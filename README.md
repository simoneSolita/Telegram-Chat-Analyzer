# Telegram-Chat-Analyzer
Software that , given a JSON of the chat data, shows you statistics.

# How it works<br />
Download the json data of your Telegram chat in a JSON format And rename it like:<br />
‘result_{YOURGROUPNAME}.json’<br />
So the Group called "My DnD Group" be:<br />
‘result_MyDnDGroup.json’<br />
Put the Json File inside input directory.  <br />
Then change the properties.toml with the name of your group and then run copy_json_to_db.py<br />
